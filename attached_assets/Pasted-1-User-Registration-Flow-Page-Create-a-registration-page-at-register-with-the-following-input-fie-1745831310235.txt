{
  "otp": "123456"
}
On successful OTP verification:

Store the received token in localStorage with the key token.

Redirect the user to the home page (/ route).

3. State Management with Redux Toolkit
Setup:

Configure Redux Toolkit for global state management.

Create an authSlice to handle authentication-related state, including:

User information.

Authentication status.

Token management.

Actions:

registerUser: Handles user registration API call.

verifyOtp: Handles OTP verification API call.

setToken: Stores the token in both Redux state and localStorage.

logout: Clears user data and token from state and localStorage.

4. Routing and Access Control
Public Routes:

/login

/register

Accessible only when the user is not authenticated.

Protected Routes:

/ (Home page)

Any other routes that require authentication.

Accessible only when the user is authenticated.

Redirection Logic:

If an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected route, redirect them to /login.

If an authenticated user tries to access /login or /register, redirect them to /.

Store the base URL in an environment variable.

File: .env.local

6. User Experience Enhancements

Use toast notifications or inline messages styled with Tailwind CSS.

Ensure the OTP modal is accessible via keyboard navigation.

Provide clear instructions and labels for input fields.
